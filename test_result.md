# Test Results - ROBOT Level 1 Admin Panel

## User Problem Statement
User requested improvements to ROBOT Admin Panel:
- Fix inactive "Create Category" button and ensure all buttons have proper cursor pointer behavior
- Avoid white text on #FFF7EA background, use #CB5544 background buttons instead
